Welcome to your personalized data analysis tool for dye release kinetics and biosensor calibration!

**Capabilities of this app:**
- 📥 Upload and extract absorbance data from a 96-well plate
- 📈 Create a calibration curve with regression analysis
- 📊 Generate and analyze dye release profiles from PEG hydrogels
- 🧮 Automatically calculate averages, standard errors, and concentrations
- 💾 Store and organize your results in a searchable in-app database

Use the sidebar (top left) to navigate between modules:
- **Calibration Curve**
- **Release Profile**
- **Database (Coming Soon)**

Let's get started by uploading your data on the Calibration Curve page!
